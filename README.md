# Infrastructure & Cloud Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio repository.  
This site documents my **hands-on infrastructure, cloud, and platform engineering work**, alongside a focused certification roadmap designed to support real-world systems—not credential collecting.

This repository backs my **GitHub Pages portfolio website**, where projects, labs, and progress are documented in detail.

## 🎯 Career Focus

I am focused on growing into senior-level roles such as:

- Cloud Infrastructure Engineer  
- Platform Engineer  
- Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)  
- Infrastructure-Focused Cloud Architect  

My emphasis is on **building, operating, automating, and securing systems at scale**.

## 🧰 Core Technologies & Skills

- **Cloud:** Microsoft Azure (primary), AWS (secondary)
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, Azure Bicep / ARM
- **Containers & Platform:** Kubernetes (AKS), containerized workloads
- **Operating Systems:** Linux (enterprise-focused), Windows Server
- **Networking:** Routing, switching, subnetting, hybrid connectivity
- **Automation & Scripting:**
  - PowerShell (advanced)
  - Python (infrastructure & automation)
- **DevOps / Reliability:** CI/CD, monitoring, incident response fundamentals
- **Security:** Identity, segmentation, least privilege, secure architectures

## 📜 Certifications

### ✅ Completed

- **AZ-900** – Microsoft Azure Fundamentals  
- **AZ-104** – Microsoft Azure Administrator  

---

### 🔜 Planned (Next 2–3 Years)

This roadmap is intentionally **limited and high-impact**, aligned directly with production infrastructure and platform engineering work.

#### Infrastructure & Platform
- **AZ-305** – Azure Solutions Architect *(high priority)*
- **CCNA** – Cisco Certified Network Associate
- **Linux Certification** – RHCSA or equivalent
- **Terraform Associate** – HashiCorp

#### DevOps & Reliability
- **AZ-400** – Azure DevOps Engineer *(infrastructure-focused)*
- **Kubernetes** – CKA or AKS-focused mastery

#### Architecture
- **CITA-A** – IASA Associate Architect
- **TOGAF** – Enterprise Architecture Framework

> Security leadership certifications (CISSP, CCSP, CISM) are planned **later**, after deeper production and architectural experience is established.

## 💻 Projects & Labs

This portfolio emphasizes **applied engineering**, not theory.

Representative projects include:

### 🔹 Azure Infrastructure Platform
- Secure Azure landing zone design
- VNets, subnets, routing, NSGs
- Linux workloads
- Infrastructure-as-Code using Terraform and Azure Bicep

### 🔹 Kubernetes Platform (AKS)
- Cluster deployment and hardening
- RBAC and namespace isolation
- Ingress, monitoring, and reliability patterns

### 🔹 Automation & Operations
- PowerShell and Python automation
- CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure
- Operational documentation and runbooks

Each project includes:
- Architecture diagrams
- IaC source code
- Security considerations
- Lessons learned and operational notes
